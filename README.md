to run the group chat, first run the server by typing the following:
$ python server.py

then to connect clients to the server, type:
$ python client.py <address> 5000 <username>

where address is the IP address of the server and username is the name you would like to go by in the chat.

You will need to have a seperate terminal for the server and for every client.
